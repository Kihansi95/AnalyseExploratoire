Project funcionality files
---------------------------------
I (Duc) made several file for different functionalities (preprocessing dataset, etc.), in order to share experience, feel free to add your functionality file so that I can reuse later.  
If you want to avoid retyping those codes, use __source(file="filename.R")__
* __preprocessing.R__ format data in the correct form, i.e tranform data into factor/int/float. The file preprocess different dataset, need to see further into the file to know for what dataset it formats.

Pratical Notes
---------------------------------
* Don't forget to change the workspace into the project in order to avoid linkage dependency. (Use __Ctrl + Shift (Maj.) + H__).
* To clear console in R : __Ctrl+L__
* Datasets are found in the folder data. You will find different project lied on different dataset that are stated in the above section.
* From RStudio, __Shift + Left Click__ the source link will open the page

Report Note:
---------------------------------
* The report would be in format `.Rmd`
* The document can be written in [Rmardown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html), see more in [pdf format](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html#table-of-contents-1)
